# Smart TicTacToe

An AI-driven Tic Tac Toe game using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.

Assignment @ Artificial Intelligence

## Description

- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Enhances the Minimax algorithm by reducing the number of nodes evaluated, making the AI more efficient.
- **Unbeatable AI**: The AI is designed to never lose, providing a challenging opponent for players.
- **Advanced AlphaBeta Pruning**: Uses a heuristic to find the best possible move along with pruning.
- **Parallel Minimax**: Parallelizes minimax by creating 2 threads.
